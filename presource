PAUSE DESIGN 

* **Nature of the pause:** The pauses in Pause are natural pauses. This means that they are pauses that would naturally occur in a conversation. They are not artificial pauses that are inserted into the audio for the purpose of helping learners.

* **Design of the pause:** The length of the pauses in Pause can be adjusted by the learner. This allows learners to customize the pauses to their own needs. For example, a learner who is just starting out might need longer pauses, while a more advanced learner might be able to handle shorter pauses.

* **Nuance of the pause:** The pauses in Pause are nuanced. This means that they are not all the same length. The length of the pauses varies depending on the context of the audio. For example, a pause might be longer after a complex sentence than after a simple sentence.
